# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Go-Flow is a specialized Go library for building, visualizing, and executing complex data and processing pipelines using a declarative, flow-based programming model. This feature addresses the critical gap in the Go ecosystem by providing compile-time type safety, native Go graph definition, and automatic visualization for data transformation pipelines. The library enables developers to define data processing pipelines as strongly-typed, interconnected graphs of components directly in Go code, with the Go compiler ensuring type safety across all connections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Declarative Pipeline Definition

2. WHEN components are added to a pipeline THEN the system SHALL enforce that each component has clearly defined input and output ports with explicit types
3. WHEN connections are established between components THEN the system SHALL validate type compatibility at compile time
4. WHEN a pipeline is defined THEN the system SHALL support both simple linear pipelines and complex multi-branch, multi-merge graphs
5. WHEN components are connected THEN the system SHALL prevent connecting incompatible types or creating cycles
6. WHEN a pipeline definition is written THEN the system SHALL ensure the code reads naturally and is self-documenting

### Requirement 2: Compile-Time Graph Validation

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want the library to leverage Go's type system to validate pipeline correctness at compile time, so that I can catch errors before runtime and ensure pipeline integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are connected THEN the system SHALL perform type compatibility checking across all connections
2. WHEN a pipeline is compiled THEN the system SHALL detect disconnected components or orphaned ports
3. WHEN a pipeline graph is analyzed THEN the system SHALL detect cycles in the graph structure
4. WHEN pipeline validation runs THEN the system SHALL verify that all required input ports are connected
5. WHEN component dependencies are checked THEN the system SHALL verify that component dependencies are satisfied
6. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
7. WHEN using Go generics THEN the system SHALL enforce type safety at connection points

### Requirement 3: Automatic Visualization Generation

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want to generate visual representations of pipeline graphs directly from Go code without manual intervention, so that I can document and understand complex data flows immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pipeline is defined THEN the system SHALL generate visual representations in multiple output formats (Graphviz DOT, SVG, PNG, interactive HTML)
2. WHEN visualizations are generated THEN the system SHALL clearly represent component types, connections, and data flow direction
3. WHEN displaying pipelines THEN the system SHALL use color coding for different data types and component categories
4. WHEN analyzing pipelines THEN the system SHALL provide ability to highlight critical paths or bottlenecks
5. WHEN integrating with documentation tools THEN the system SHALL support integration with popular documentation tools and CI/CD pipelines
6. WHEN generating layouts THEN the system SHALL use built-in graph analysis to determine optimal layout
7. WHEN customizing appearance THEN the system SHALL provide customizable styling and theming options

4. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL support data transformers (mappers, filters, aggregators, joiners)
5. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL support data sinks (file writers, database writers, API publishers)
6. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL support control flow components (routers, splitters, mergers)
7. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL support utility components (loggers, metrics collectors, error handlers)

### Requirement 5: Execution Engine Architecture

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want a flexible, high-performance execution engine that can run pipelines efficiently, so that I can process data with optimal performance while maintaining the ability to plug in custom execution strategies.
